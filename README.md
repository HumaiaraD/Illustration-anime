# Illustration-anime
Simple animation of  a face card using GSAP and SVG.

For the Illustration I used Adobe Illustrator. Then I had converted the file into an svg file. Copied all the long lines of code and created a very simple up and down moving animation of a head and eyes looking left and right. Attaching a video for you to see.
